### Intro

In this tutorial we will integrate WINGS forecasting into OpenZeppelin crowdsale.

Previous tutorial from this series, integrating WINGS into the crowdsale: https://github.com/stefek99/wings-integration/blob/master/tutorial/wings-integration-tutorial-readme.md

### Note about OpenZeppelin

Description from their website:

> OpenZeppelin is an open framework of reusable and secure smart contracts in the Solidity language.

They have fantastic developer community and many smart contracts are using their code.

Their code is well tested, frequently updated, neatly organized and the ICO contract out-of-the-box supports many common. In other words - cannot recommend OpenZeppelin highly enough.



### Getting WINGS integration code

There are a few ways of getting WINGS code in place, personally I prefer copy-paste directly from GitHub repository as there are currently only 2 files:

* [`ICrowdsaleProcessor.sol`](https://github.com/WingsDao/wings-integration/blob/master/contracts/interfaces/ICrowdsaleProcessor.sol)
* [`BasicCrowdsale.sol`](https://github.com/WingsDao/wings-integration/blob/master/contracts/BasicCrowdsale.sol) 

Another options is to 

1. Clone GitHub repository: https://github.com/WingsDao/wings-integration

`git clone https://github.com/WingsDao/wings-integration`

2. Install from `npm`: https://www.npmjs.com/package/wings-integration

`npm i wings-integration`


### Tool we will use

In the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/stefek99/wings-integration/blob/master/tutorial/wings-integration-tutorial-readme.md) we didn't use Truffle. This time around...


### Testing
