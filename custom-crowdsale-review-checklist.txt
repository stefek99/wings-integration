Custom crowdsale review checklist
=================================

While writing or reviewing custom Crowdsale contracts, please meet the following requirements:

1. The contract has to be written in Solidity language and derive directly from BasicCrowdsale;
2. If stop() is overriden by derived contract then super.stop(...) (i.e BasicCrowdsale.stop()) must be called inside;
3. If start() is overriden by derived contract then super.start(...) (i.e BasicCrowdsale.start()) must be called inside;
4. Timestamps, as well as minimal goal and hard cap cannot be modified after BasicCrowdsale.start() is called;
5. totalCollected and totalSold fields increase during every token sale for right amounts;
6. Contract cannot sell tokens before startTimestamp, after endTimestamp;
7. Contract cannot sell tokens above hard cap;
8. Project owner must be able to withdraw collected ETH only after the crowdsale completed successfully and only to the fundingAddress provided in start();
9. If the crowdsale failed or cancelled, all participants should have an ability to refund their ETH;
